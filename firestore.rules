/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a public read-only model for the "Badman Tips" application.
 * Given that the application supports anonymous access without user sign-up, the primary
 * security goal is to expose prediction data for public consumption while strictly
 * preventing any client-side modifications. All data creation, updates, and deletions
 * are expected to be handled by a trusted backend service (e.g., a Cloud Function
 * with Admin SDK credentials), which bypasses these security rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All application data is stored in a single, top-level collection: `/tips`.
 * There are no user-specific subcollections, as the application does not manage user accounts or private data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: The `/tips` collection is fully readable by anyone,
 *   including anonymous users, to support the "Today's Tips" and "30-Day Tips" views.
 * - No Client Writes: All client-side write operations (create, update, delete) are
 *   explicitly denied. This is a critical security measure to protect the integrity
 *   of the prediction data from unauthorized changes.
 * - Backend-Managed Data: The rules are designed with the assumption that a trusted
 *   server-side process is responsible for managing the lifecycle of prediction documents.
